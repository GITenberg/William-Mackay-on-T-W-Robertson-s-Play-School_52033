<h1>William Mackay on T. W. Robertson&rsquo;s New Play,<br />
&ldquo;School.&rdquo;</h1>
<p>This is the story of how William Mackay, then studying for the
law, wrote his first published piece, leading to his career in
newspapers.&nbsp; The letters that occasioned the piece and a
criticism of Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s play are given first for
context, followed by Mackay&rsquo;s account and then his first
published piece.&mdash;DP.</p>
<h2><i>The Times</i>, 20 January 1869<br />
<i>TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES</i>.</h2>
<p>Sir,&mdash;It may be of some interest to you or your readers
to learn that the comedy <i>School</i> now performed at the
Prince of Wales&rsquo;s Theatre is a play which was performed
with great success at the principal theatres in Germany last
year, and that Mr. Robertson has only the merit of
translation.&nbsp; I myself have seen it acted in Hamburg and
Cologne.&nbsp; I do not think Mr. Robertson will deny this
fact.</p>
<p>I enclose my card, and beg to subscribe myself</p>
<p style="text-align: right">VERITAS.</p>
<p>Jan. 18.</p>
<p><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup> Why does not
&ldquo;Veritas&rdquo; give the name of the German play?</p>
<h2><i>The Times</i>, 21 January 1869<br />
MR. ROBERTSON&rsquo;S NEW PLAY.<br />
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.</h2>
<p>Sir,&mdash;I am thankful to you for reminding me that I had
forgotten to give the name of the German play acted in the Prince
of Wales&rsquo;s Theatre under the name <i>School</i>.&nbsp; It
is called there Aschenbr&ouml;del, and the author is Mr. Robert
Benedix, a well-known theatrical author.</p>
<p>I remain, Sir, your obedient servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">VERITAS.</p>
<p>January 20.</p>
<h2><i>The Times</i>, 26 January 1869<br />
MR. ROBERTSON&rsquo;S &ldquo;SCHOOL&rdquo;.<br />
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.</h2>
<p>Sir,&mdash;Is Mr. Robertson going to contradict or explain the
allegation made in your columns on the 20th and 21st inst., that
his so-called new play is, in fact, a German play,
<i>Aschenbr&ouml;del</i>, by Robert Benedix?&nbsp; The public
have a right to be informed on this point, as <i>School</i> was
put forward and accepted as an original work.&nbsp; If the charge
is true, it becomes difficult to understand the morality of those
concerned.&nbsp; If your correspondent&rsquo;s statement be
incorrect, Mr. Robertson and Miss Wilton owe it to themselves to
say so.</p>
<p>I am, Sir, your obedient servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">R. S. E.</p>

<h2><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>Once A
Week, 6 February 1869<br />
<span class="smcap">New Comedies</span>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the new year has come new luck
to the theatres.&nbsp; Covent Garden, and Drury Lane, with their
pantomimes, are doing wonderfully well; the new Gaiety, with its
brilliant extravaganza un-dresses, and Mr. Alfred Wigan&rsquo;s
admirable acting in the second piece, is, and has been, drawing
crowded houses.&nbsp; The Strand, with its old burlesque, <i>The
Field of the Cloth of Gold</i>, is taking its share of the luck,
and the little Royalty&rsquo;s novel style of burlesque-drama,
<i>Claude du Val</i>, is in for as prosperous if not as lengthy a
career as fell to the lot of <i>Black-eyed Susan</i>.&nbsp; The
sensation drama is for a time in abeyance until Mr. Watts
Phillips produces his next at the Queen&rsquo;s, and its
startling companion at the Holborn.&nbsp; The Princess&rsquo;s
coquetting with Mr. Boucicault, takes up with Mr. Palgrave
Simpson, and plays his <i>Marie Antoinette</i>.</p>
<p>Two theatres are playing comedy, pure and simple; rather pure,
and peculiarly simple.&nbsp; At the Haymarket, Mr. Buckstone now
plays a comedy by T. W. Robertson, entitled <i>Home</i>; and at
the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s Miss Marie Wilton has produced a
comedy by the same author, called <i>School</i>.&nbsp; Both are
successful, on both a vast amount of praise has been lavished,
and about both a great deal of nonsense has been written.</p>
<p><i>Home</i> is an adaptation of
<i>L&rsquo;Aventuri&egrave;re</i>; and <i>School</i>, is an
adaptation of a German piece; a fact of which but for the letters
of Veritas, to the <i>Times</i>, most of us would have remained
in blissful ignorance.</p>
<p>It matters not one atom to the public whether these plays are
in every sense original (as we suppose the author&rsquo;s
<i>Caste</i> was&mdash;his third, and, to our mind his best) or
are translated literally, or adapted ingeniously from the French,
German, Sanskrit, or Hindu.&nbsp; The public, in general, goes to
the theatre to be amused, and so long as this end is attained,
cares nothing for details, however interesting they may be from a
literary or artistic point of view.&nbsp; <i>School</i> and
<i>Home</i> satisfy the public, which passes a very pleasant
evening in seeing each piece&mdash;so far so good.&nbsp; With
whom, then, and with what do we find fault?&nbsp; Assuredly with
Mr. Robertson, if he has tacitly taken to himself and the praise
which generous admiring critics have publicly given him.&nbsp;
For what has been specially praised? what has specially attracted
their notice in <i>School</i>?&nbsp; Why, the author&rsquo;s
originality of invention and graceful fancies, as displayed in
(1) the choice of the old fairy story <i>Cinderella</i> on which
to base an idyllic story; (2) the carrying out this idea at the
end in fitting the slipper on the girl&rsquo;s foot; (3) the
love-making in the moonlight, when Lord Beaufoy and Bella talk in
spooney tones about their shadows.&nbsp; Now it appears that not
only has the Cinderella idea <i>not</i> originated in Mr.
Robertson&rsquo;s inner consciousness, but, beside the incident
underlying the whole plot, the very name Cinderella was that of
the original German play.&nbsp; We regret that facts like these
have not been either acknowledged or contradicted by the
author.&nbsp; For we are, and have been, glad, in the true
interests of English dramatic art, to point to the author of
<i>Caste</i>, <i>Ours</i>, and <i>Society</i>, as an original
writer whose successful career is a sufficient answer to the
taunts of the French dramatists and their admirers amongst
ourselves.</p>
<p>The first act of <i>School</i> contains the gem of the piece
in the way of dialogue, which rises here to true comedy
standard.&nbsp; We allude to the luncheon in the wood, where Lord
Beaufoy the beau, and Jack Poyntz converse together.&nbsp;
Suggested by the original German or not, it is excellent.&nbsp;
The scene is pretty, nothing remarkable; the schoolgirls sing
with a unanimity perfectly astonishing, except, perhaps, to
German schoolgirls out for a holiday after the foreign-peasant
fashion.</p>
<p>The second act is a farce, and a stupid farce, too.&nbsp; Mr.
Hare&rsquo;s performance of the old beau is good, though not up
to his previous delineations of character.</p>
<p>The third act is notable for its moonlight love-making
scene.&nbsp; The dialogue runs somewhat in this
fashion,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Lord Beaufoy</i> (<i>to Bella</i>), My shadow
is taller than yours.</p>
<p><i>Bella</i> (<i>to Lord B.</i>).&nbsp; Your shadow is shorter
than mine.</p>
<p><i>Lord B.</i>&nbsp; Now we&rsquo;re together.</p>
<p><i>Bella</i>.&nbsp; Now we&rsquo;re apart.</p>
<p><i>Lord B.</i>&nbsp; Now we&rsquo;re together again.</p>
<p><i>Bella</i>.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; The jug (<i>a milk jug in her
hand</i>) joins us.</p>
<p><i>Lord B.</i> (<i>with pathos</i>).&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; But only
for a time.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>Exeunt to get the milk</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, we are told, that Mr. Robertson is a second Douglas
Jerrold!&nbsp; No, this is certainly not the parallel.&nbsp; Mr.
Robertson, in a way, may be the Antony Trollope of the drama; <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>not as
Jerrold, a writer of epigrams, repartees, and sparkling
witticisms, but a very lively recorder of such natural
conversation as would pass between two ordinary people, in an
ordinary situation.</p>
<p>We should be inclined to say that it is upon this absence of
style, polish, and turn, that Mr. Robertson especially prides
himself.&nbsp; For ourselves we would rather have a comedy be the
concentrated essence of conversation, trimmed, pruned, and
polished, up to the <i>School for Scandal</i> smoothness and
brilliancy.</p>
<p>As for <i>Home</i>, the first act is a prologue, the second is
the play, the third is the epilogue.&nbsp; The three chief
characters are more or less unprincipled, one of them (played by
Mr. Sothern) justifying the end by the means; and the sympathy of
the audience is, at the conclusion, entirely with the designing
woman whose schemes have been foiled by the aforesaid
unprincipled son.&nbsp; Much has been said in praise of the
business of the love-making at the piano.&nbsp; There is nothing
new under the sun or behind the foot-lights, and the details of
this, the diffidence, the short sentences, the shyness, the
nervousness, are as old as stage-courtship itself.&nbsp; Mr.
Sothern gets some laughs out of misplacing words, by a sort of
Dundreary habit, and obtains one roar by upsetting a music-stand
when he is talking to the young lady at the piano.&nbsp; He makes
false love, with affected earnestness, as he did in <i>A Lesson
for Life</i>, and his stage business is all good and
careful.&nbsp; By the way, there is a too brilliant screen in the
corner, which distracts the attention of the audience.&nbsp; It
is never used during the play, nothing is done with it, and,
unless it be used to conceal some one who plays the piano,
(something of the sort was done in <i>Golden Daggers</i>, at the
Princess&rsquo;s) while Miss Hill is pretending to perform a
brilliant waltz, the screen is useless&mdash;is worse, being an
eye-sore.</p>
<p>In fine, we shall be glad to see another piece of Mr.
Robertson&rsquo;s, but he owes it to his friends and the public,
to inform us of its originality: and we heartily advise him to
work his own ground, and to leave the French, German, and Italian
fields to those who have no fertile soil of their own.</p>
<h2>From &ldquo;Bohemian Days in Fleet Street&rdquo;<br />
By William Mackay.</h2>
<p>When &ldquo;School&rdquo; had been running for some little
time, a letter appeared in the <i>Times</i>, conceived in that
spirit of dignified rebuke which, in its correspondents, seems to
have appealed to successive editors of that great
newspaper.&nbsp; In this communication Robertson was crudely
accused of having stolen the play, lock, stock, and barrel, from
a play then (or recently) running in Germany.&nbsp; I had no
acquaintance with the German language and no time (so insistent
on protest was my indignation) to inquire into the facts.&nbsp;
But I felt that from the internal evidence afforded by
&ldquo;School&rdquo; I would be able to make a good case.&nbsp;
Even in those remote days many of our most admired articles of
so-called British manufacture were &ldquo;made in Germany,&rdquo;
and most of them bore about with them the ineffaceable signs of
their origin.&nbsp; I strongly felt that on internal evidence I
should have little difficulty, in that &ldquo;School&rdquo; was
&ldquo;quite English, you know,&rdquo; and that, above all, there
was no trace whatever of anything German in the conception or the
treatment.&nbsp; I had already seen the play a second <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>time when the
<i>Times</i> letter made its appearance.&nbsp; On the night of
the day on which it was published I paid a third visit to the pit
of the Tottenham Street playhouse.&nbsp; When I got back to my
&ldquo;diggings,&rdquo; I sat down and commenced to write what I
intended to be a letter to Jupiter Tonans of Printing House
Square, but what turned out to be my first professional
contribution to the London Press.&nbsp; Next day I abandoned my
more legitimate studies, and rewrote and polished&mdash;as well
as I knew how&mdash;the essay over which I had burned my first
sacrifice of midnight oil.&nbsp; The result was in no way
suitable as a letter in the correspondence column of a
newspaper.&nbsp; My own poor outlook assured me of that.&nbsp;
Where to send the essay?&nbsp; A copy of a weekly magazine called
<i>Once a Week</i> lay on a chair in the room.&nbsp; I caught it
up, looked for the editorial address, wrote a brief note to the
editor apprising him of the drift of my contribution, addressed
an envelope, and posted my &ldquo;stuff,&rdquo; as I subsequently
learned to call my articles in manuscript.</p>
<p>Had a mentor, skilled to advise, been available at that
moment, he would no doubt have advised me to send my essay to any
other publication, but <i>not</i> to <i>Once a Week</i>, because
the paper in question was then under the editorial control of a
member of the staff of the <i>Times</i>.&nbsp; So that&mdash;a
circumstance of which I was happily ignorant&mdash;the organ
selected haphazard for my venture was the very last that should
be likely to serve my purpose.&nbsp; Four days after its despatch
I received a proof of the article with a request that it should
be &ldquo;returned immediately&rdquo; to the printer.&nbsp; A
delightful sensation&mdash;that of correcting one&rsquo;s first
galleys of matter moist from the press!&nbsp; The following week
the article appeared in all the pride of print, though I confess
that the pride of print (a mere figurative locution) was as
nothing to the pride of the author who already saw himself on the
high-road to fame and fortune.&nbsp; Alas! it is a highroad
which, while the gayest and cheeriest to travel, rarely leads to
fame, and never to fortune. . . . I have no doubt that this first
published composition of mine was a tremendously faulty piece of
work&mdash;immature and pretentious.&nbsp; But the appearance of
no subsequent production of mine <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>has afforded me a tithe of the
pleasure.&nbsp; And, incidentally, it was the means of my making
the acquaintance of &ldquo;Tom&rdquo; Robertson.</p>
<h2><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>Once
a Week, 27 March 1869<br />
<span class="smcap">School</span>.<br />
By William Mackay.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> in these days a dramatic
author achieves undoubted success, without having recourse to
sensational incident, to intricacies of plot, and to impossible
situations, something has occurred to arrest the attention of
those who are eternally bemoaning the degraded position of the
modern stage.&nbsp; There is a play being performed in London at
present which has ensnared the public into admiration; which
fills a theatre night after night with pleased audiences; and in
which, strange to say, there is introduced no railway train, no
hansom cab, no real pump.&nbsp; The title of the play is
<i>School</i>.&nbsp; The object of this article is to discover,
if possible, the secret of the author&rsquo;s success.</p>
<p>We take it for granted that the cloud of accusation which,
erewhile, hung over Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s head has been
dissipated.&nbsp; Lord Macaulay informs us in his essay on Byron,
that the British public is subject to periodical fits of
morality.&nbsp; When <i>School</i> was produced at the Prince of
Wales&rsquo; Theatre, the town was suffering from one of these
attacks.&nbsp; Almost every event became a text.&nbsp; But it so
happened that anent public exhibitions the Briton was especially
asserting himself.&nbsp; The State was interfering in the matter
of stage petticoats, and various journals were waxing eloquent <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>over the
degrading and demoralising spectacle of the Siamese Twins.&nbsp;
It was impossible that <i>School</i> should escape.&nbsp; True
there are no legs displayed in Tottenham Street,&mdash;nothing
there to offend a correct taste.&nbsp; In a happy moment,
however, it was discovered that Mr. Robertson had translated his
comedy from the German.&nbsp; Here, indeed, was a charge of
immorality compared with which an accusation of legs would be
less than trivial.&nbsp; What Goldsmith once called &ldquo;the
busy disposition of some correspondents,&rdquo; went to work with
a will.&nbsp; Printing House Square helped it to utterance, and
in a day or two the town rang with the echoes of it.&nbsp; Those
who have read the German play about which the correspondents
wrote, have been able to convince themselves, and those who have
not, will have by this time been convinced by the <i>Times</i>
article on the question that <i>School</i> is not a
translation.&nbsp; Mr. Robertson has indeed borrowed the idea of
<i>a</i> play, in which a boarding-school should afford some of
the characters, and the legend of <i>Cinderella</i> a
background.&nbsp; Further than this, the author of <i>School</i>
is not indebted to his continental contemporary.&nbsp; If there
be criminality in so borrowing we should at once commence to
measure modern authors with a standard higher than that which we
apply to the great masters of the dramatic art.</p>
<p>But, after all, the most convincing refutation of the charge
of translation is afforded by the comedy itself.&nbsp; With one
exception (that of Krux the tutor) can anything be more
thoroughly, more peculiarly English than the delineation of the
<i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> of <i>School</i>&mdash;than the
dialogue, the channels in which it runs, and the allusions with
which it is studded?</p>
<p>Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s comedy, then, is not a
translation.&nbsp; And in crossing the channel to search for the
author&rsquo;s model, critics have put themselves to unnecessary
trouble.&nbsp; A great deal of the press praise lavished on our
author has been excessive.&nbsp; And probably no one feels this
more than the author himself.&nbsp; Mr. Robertson does not write
for immortality.&nbsp; His plays will never be <i>read</i>; after
a few years, probably, will cease to be acted even.&nbsp; He is
not a Sheridan, any more than Sheridan was a Shakspeare.&nbsp;
But he is a dramatic author, capable of portraying a character
with ability and finish, and of writing dialogue which is
sometimes sparkling, often charming, and always clever.&nbsp; And
much of his success in these respects is attributable, as we
think, to his having studied earnestly the writings of
Thackeray.&nbsp; This idea has not suddenly and only now occurred
to us.&nbsp; When we first saw it, we thought that <i>Society</i>
was not altogether uninfluenced by <i>Vanity Fair</i>.&nbsp; And
although in <i>Caste</i> and <i>Ours</i> the genius of the master
was not so observable, it reasserted itself in <i>Play</i>, and
in the author&rsquo;s latest production it is more than ever
felt.&nbsp; In endeavouring to show the extent of
Thackeray&rsquo;s influence on Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s work, we
purpose confining ourselves to that latest production.</p>
<p>Glancing over the bill we meet with one or two of
Thackeray&rsquo;s names.&nbsp; We have Farintosh, we have
Poyntz.&nbsp; Mere indications these.&nbsp; But useful,
nevertheless, as evidence in confirmation of our
theory&mdash;straws indicating from what quarter the wind of
inspiration blows.&nbsp; When the curtain rises we meet with
something more convincing than indications.</p>
<p>We meet, for example, with Beau Farintosh.&nbsp; It would be
silliness to attempt to identify Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s Beau
Farintosh with any of Thackeray&rsquo;s characters.&nbsp; The
points of dissimilarity are almost as numerous as the points of
similarity to that character which he most resembles.&nbsp; But
what reader of the <i>History of Pendennis</i>, having seen
<i>School</i>, was not constantly reminded by Beau Farintosh of
that delightful but godless old dandy Major Pendennis, who, as we
all know, &ldquo;could not have faced the day without his two
hours&rsquo; toilet.&rdquo;&nbsp; Major Pendennis had a nephew;
so has Beau Farintosh.&nbsp; The name of the Pendennis nephew was
Arthur; Beau Farintosh&rsquo;s nephew is an Arthur too.&nbsp; But
the resemblance does not confine itself to names.&nbsp; Before
Farintosh has been ten minutes on the stage he gives his nephew
sundry sage but dreadfully worldly counsels on the subject of
marriage, which set us thinking of very similar advices confided
years ago by Major Pendennis to <i>his</i> nephew.&nbsp; In
manner also the Beau possesses a strong family likeness to the
Major.&nbsp; There are little peculiarities of thought and
expression common to both.&nbsp; Major Pendennis especially, when
conversing with an author, was wont to adorn his conversation
with little allusions and quotations, just as samples of what he
<i>could</i> do were he so intended, &ldquo;Tempora mutantur,
egad.&nbsp; And whatever is, is right, as Shakspeare says,&rdquo;
said the Major one afternoon in Pall Mall.&nbsp; The Beau is
equally happy in his allusions.&nbsp; &ldquo;Arthur, Arthur, this
is blasphemy&mdash;atheism&mdash;reminds me of Burke and
Hare&mdash;and, and, Voltaire.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps on scientific
matters the Beau surpasses the Major.&nbsp; In act ii. of
<i>School</i> one of the young ladies has given an answer
displaying a more than ordinary amount of stupidity, upon which
the Beau expresses his delight by declaring that
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a remarkable <a name="page240"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 240</span>girl; a perfect Sir Humphrey Davy,
begad.&rdquo;&nbsp; How the Beau&rsquo;s studied compliments to
the young ladies, of whom he &ldquo;can&rsquo;t distinguish a
feature,&rdquo; seem familiar to us.&nbsp; And as to his
&ldquo;God bless you, Arthur,&rdquo; Pendennis senior has said it
to Pendennis junior a hundred times.&nbsp; The two characters
most resemble each other (I should rather say, remind us most of
each other; for, in good sooth, the <i>characters</i> differ most
at this point, though the resemblance of manner is strongest)
towards the close of the comedy, and towards the close of the
novel.&nbsp; I Beau Farintosh&rsquo;s interview with his nephew
in the last act of the play will bear a not unfavourable
comparison with those passages in chapter seventy of
<i>Pendennis</i>, in which the Major beseeches Arthur to marry
Blanche Amory, &ldquo;Arthur,&rdquo; says Major Pendennis,
&ldquo;for the sake of a poor broken-down old fellow who has
always been dev&rsquo;lish fond of you, don&rsquo;t fling this
chance away&mdash;I pray you&mdash;I beg you . . . dammy, on my
knees, there, I beg of you don&rsquo;t do this.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
when Arthur&rsquo;s resolution shatters the fond hopes of the old
soldier, he goes on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done my best, and said my
say; and I&rsquo;m a dev&rsquo;lish old fellow.&nbsp;
And&mdash;and&mdash;it don&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp; And&mdash;and
Shakspeare was right&mdash;and Cardinal Wolsey, begad&mdash;and
had I but served my God as I have served you&mdash;yes, on my
knees by Jove, to my own nephew&mdash;I mightn&rsquo;t have
been&mdash;&nbsp; Good night, sir, you needn&rsquo;t trouble
yourself to call again.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is, of course,
inimitable.&nbsp; The master-hand is there.&nbsp; But the later
author has put a pathos into the Beau&rsquo;s confession of old
age&mdash;confession after so many years of hair from Truefitts,
and bloom from Bond Street, too forceful to be ludicrous.&nbsp;
And the tears which he makes the repentant old sinner shed are
too genuine to be thought other than natural.</p>
<p>In the plays of Mr. Robertson it is a general resemblance to
the novels of Thackeray which arrests us, and not so much a
similarity of particular characters.&nbsp; Ever and anon we
happen upon little well-known touches, peculiarities of
expression, turns of sentiment, moralisings, teachings, which
convince us of the justice of our assumption.&nbsp; They are
impressions of &ldquo;the touch of a vanish&rsquo;d
hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are echoes &ldquo;of a voice that is
still.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thackeray very largely adopted a strain, half
satire, half banter, with regard to certain shams both in high
and low places.&nbsp; Some people, who didn&rsquo;t know the
meaning of words, called this strain cynicism.&nbsp; And, at one
time, it was considered quite the fashion to dub Thackeray a
cynic.&nbsp; People know better now, let us hope.&nbsp; This
note, or strain, is easy of detection in <i>School</i>.&nbsp; In
act i. it is particularly noticeable.</p>
<p>There is one scene in the play&mdash;in the third
act&mdash;which has been regarded with especial admiration by the
public; and concerning which some of the journals have gone into
ecstasies.&nbsp; It is a scene, however, concerning the merit of
which there is a difference of opinion.&nbsp; When a thing is
loudly praised by the Philistines, the children of light turn up
their noses.&nbsp; We are referring to the moonlight scene, in
which Bella and Lord Beaufoy are the actors.&nbsp; To us the bit
of sentiment about the jug is a touch worthy of Sterne.&nbsp; The
comparison of the shadows, and the allusions to the distance of
the moon, are very susceptible of burlesque.&nbsp; But when in
<i>Vanity Fair</i> we read of Miss Sharp&rsquo;s walk in the
moonlight with Captain Osborne, and listen to her as she says,
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d think the moon was two hundred and thirty-six
thousand eight hundred and forty-seven miles off?&rdquo; it never
occurs to us to burlesque <i>that</i>.</p>
<p>The letter of Jack Poyntz to Naomi Tighe is just such a
composition as Thackeray would attribute to a young officer of
the Poyntz stamp; even to the bad spelling.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
spells cochineal with two ee&rsquo;s,&rdquo; says Naomi on
reading the letter; though, we should scarcely imagine, from
Naomi&rsquo;s previous appearances, that she was the most
competent to decide on matters of orthography.&nbsp; However,
&ldquo;with two ees&rdquo; is exactly the way in which Rawdon
Crawley would have spelt cochineal, if the ever-watchful Becky
were not looking over his shoulder.</p>
<p>The influence of the most popular English novelist has for
some years been very potent on the stage.&nbsp; Imitators of Mr.
Dickens do alarmingly abound in these days.&nbsp; And so it
happens that we can scarcely enter a theatre without a strong
foreboding that we are about to be entertained by some thief from
Whitechapel, whose highest notion of fun consists in making
&ldquo;v&rdquo; and &ldquo;w&rdquo; interchangeable; or some
turfy clerk from the City, who relies for his power of attraction
principally upon his &ldquo;get up.&rdquo;&nbsp; That this is no
fault of the novelist (of whom we can never have too much) we
readily admit.&nbsp; The followers of Mr. Thackeray are less
numerous, and anything that indicates a spread of his influence
on the modern stage is worthy of note.&nbsp; Whatever may he said
about Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s originality, the public is right in
applauding his efforts.&nbsp; This applause is at once an
unconscious tribute to the genius of Thackeray, and a mark of
appreciation of Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s ability.&nbsp; It will <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>surely be a
matter for congratulation when eccentricities, whether from St.
Giles&rsquo;s or St. James&rsquo;s, are driven from the boards,
and when in their place we have put before us the men and
women&mdash;or something like them&mdash;which we meet in real
life, and in the pages of <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>Pendennis</i>,
and <i>The Newcomes</i>.</p>
<p>One does not like to close a notice of this kind without some
mention of the actors, on whose efforts much of the success of
the piece depends.&nbsp; In having such a company as that of the
Prince of Wales&rsquo; Theatre to undertake his characters Mr.
Robertson is especially fortunate.&nbsp; Miss Wilton is
perfection.&nbsp; Mr. Hare has genius, and his acting evinces
careful study.&nbsp; The other performers are so excellent, each
in his or her own way, that unless we mentioned all of them we
dare not mention any; and, indeed, any notice now is somewhat
after date, for has not all London seen the play, and all
Pressdom said its say anent the same?</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
